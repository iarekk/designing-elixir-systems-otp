# Mastery

Following the exercises from [Designing Elixir Systems with OTP](https://pragprog.com/titles/jgotp/designing-elixir-systems-with-otp/).

Some additions beyond the book material:

- [ ] extra unit tests, mostly showcasing Elixir's features, or expanding on concepts I found unfamiliar
- [ ] dialyzer and excoveralls tasks added (`mix dialyzer` and `mix coveralls.html` to invoke)
